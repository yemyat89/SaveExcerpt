To enable a programmer to quickly find the code he is looking for, code should be organized, and the organization apparent. That is, each logical unit in the code, from the executable, the library, the namespace, down to the individual class should have a clearly apparent responsibility. I would therefore not just document source files, but also the directories they reside in.\n\n", "created_time": 1438479866.0, "id": 2}

Accesses to the swap file are very long relative to the speed of the processor and physical memory and the operating system must juggle the need to write pages to disk with the need to retain them in memory to be used again.\n\n", "created_time": 1438479973.0, "id": 4}
