##Chrome plugin to save excerpt from websites

This Google Chrome plugin allows saving selected text and save in the server side. You can see the saved items later. It is not complete yet. Currently, you can only see the links and excerpts of mine because I haven't added authentication system yet. Main purpose is to remember only relevant parts of a website you are interested instead of the whole site being bookmarked and never recalled. I will add authentication soon to see how useful it is for users.

Technologies used are
* Flask
* Chrome extension (Javascript)
* Jquery
* Datatable
* etc

Demo is here http://excerptymt.herokuapp.com.
